The dataset is the top 10 largest hotels in Las Vegas by ranking of rooms. The data is derived from: 
https://easy.vegas/hotels/largest, last updated in April 2022. 

Of note, there are many different ways to calculate this data. For example, in some lists, the Venetian is the largest hotel by number 
of rooms, which includes the rooms under the Pallazo. This data set generally separates out the different hotels, with the exeption of 
Resorts World, possibly because all three hotels are operating different wings of the same tower/building, vs different towers/buildings/hotel names.

The app displays a minimum and maximum slider bar for number of rooms, and in an interactive response will return the inclusive list of hotels,
rank, and number of rooms with the number of rooms specified.
